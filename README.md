# Multifactor Authentication Cheatsheet

Multifactor authentication dramatically improves personal security
over simple single factor authentication by requiring addiitonal
identification beyond just a password.

## Second Factors

Common second factors include:

### SMS

The system transmits a several digit code via SMS which you then type
into a web page or app.

This approach is also cumbersome and can easily leave you hamstrung if
you don't have access to your phone (battery dead, traveling somewhere
without service, etc).

Further, SMS has been shown to be insecure - phone numbers can be
spoofed 


### Personal Security Questions

Personal security questions are bullshit. They make services less
secure, not more secure. Avoid them whenever possible. When not
possible, treat them as like passwords - generate strong passwords and
add reminders to a password manager. Never give truthful answers to
questions like your mother's maiden name or your birth place unless
you're filling in a financial application.

### App Generated Code

Stronger than SMS, you download an application like [Authy](https://www.authy.com/) or [Google
Authenticator](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?hl=en). When you need the second factor, start the app and copy
the code it shows you. You'll a brief window of time when the code is valid.

This approach is as secure as the device which runs the authenticator app.
